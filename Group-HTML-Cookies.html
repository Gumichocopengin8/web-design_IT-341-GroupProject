    <h1>Comfort Cookies</h1>
    <h2>Development Roles</h2>
    <p>Paul is responsible for most of writing on this website.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Cait is responsible for the front end design of the overall website.<br> 
    </p>
    <p>Nick is responsible for the backend programming.<br> 
    </p>
    <p>Keita is responsible for the layout of all the information.<br> 
    </p>
    <h2>Rationale</h2>
    <p>This website's aim is to help customers order both cookie ingredients and ready-made cookies. We even deliver!</p>
    <h2>Need</h2>
    <p>The purpose of the website is to supply the local community with homemade cookies from our company, and even supply them with our delicious ingredients to make their own. We are trying to fill the market for hungry 
    community members who may not have time to make desserts. We also want to provide the tools for learning how to bake for those interested.</p>
    <h2>Main Elements</h2>
    <p>The site will act as an online store for ordering premade cookies, and cookie ingredients. We will also have contact pages for questions/costumer support, social media connect, menu, tracker page for deliveries, email signup,
    terms/conditions... full list of main elements to be decided</p>
    <h2>Content</h2>
    <p>About 15-17 individual web pages.</p>
    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>Our target audience is anyone with teeth and tastebuds.</p>
    <h2>Design Considerations</h2>
    <p>We would like the website to be easily accesible for anyone to order cookies and ingredients easily. Other design goals: easy navigation, photo section on main page with scroll arrows, clickable links for social media contact,
    cohesive coloring, self-made logo, use of royalty free photos, shopping cart.</p>
    <h2>Limiting factors</h2>
    <p>Coding a shopping cart might be difficult at our skill level.</p>
